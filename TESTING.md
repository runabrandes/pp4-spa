## AUTOMATED TESTING

I have attempted automated testing but have only written very few automated tests in the end. The relevant file can be found in `booking > test_forms.py `. 

- The test that caused failed results to appear was:
![removed_test](templates/documentation/images/removed_test.png)

- The terminal was showing following message:

![terminal_error](templates/documentation/images/terminal_error_test.png)

I have decided to remove the test that caused the issues and commit the test_forms.py file without it.
